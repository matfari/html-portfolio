<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Road</h3>
<p>A story about a father and son living in a apocaliptical time. Great thriller</p>

<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
<p>Many stories from different time are told during the movie and you start notice 
    how they influenced the characters. Very interesting.</p>

<h3>Big Fish</h3>
<p>A story of a man who didnÂ´t believe the stories his absent father used to tell him. Heart touching.</p>
